## Commit Anomaly â€“ Abbilaash  

- Treasury repo registered a corrupted commit tagged to Abbilaash at 12:15 AM.  
- Abbilaash had legitimately pushed updates earlier that evening (~07:00 PM).  
- Key question: Was this commit altered post-facto, or was his account hijacked?  
- Further analysis needed on Git history integrity.
